# PID_Tuner
This programs gives PID setting for any system with a predefined system structure.
Implemented in Proteus8. 

In short, this program finds dominant pole of the systesm (Nearest pole to origin) and uses root locus method shift the 
dominant pole to desired location inorder to achieve the desire response. That is, The program delivers PID settings which 
can move the dominant pole.  

You can either directly upload the code to Arduino or you can use the hex in Proteus.
